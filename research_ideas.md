### Basic Simulation

* How does the cpull_f affect the behaviour of the flocking?

* How do diiferent initialization patterns of the agents affect the flock (random vs. clustered)?

* How does the size of the flock affect the behaviour of the flocking behaviour?

### Needs further development

* Center of mass is now one for all. How would it look like if there were plenty of CoM for given neighbours in radius

* Leadership agents. Implement leaders that have more influence on behaviour

* External stimuli: Wind force/noise, predator, a food supply

* Optimizaion Problem: e.g maximizing the speed of the flock while minimizing the distance between agents.
