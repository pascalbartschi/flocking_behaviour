import flocking_behaviour_basic

## Basic Simulation

# How does the cpull_f affect the behaviour of the flocking

# How do diiferent initialization patterns of the agents affect the flock (random vs. clustered)?

# How does the size of the flock affect the behaviour of the flocking behaviour

## Needs further development:
    
# center of mass is now one for all. How would it look like if there where plenty of com for given neighbours in 
# radius

# Leadership agents. Implement leaders that have more influence on behaviour

# External stimuli: Wind force/noise, predator, a food supply
