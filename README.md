### Description

Flocking behaviour is a collective and synchronised motion that exhibited by a group of individuals such as a flock of birds, school of fish, swarm of insects or herd of mammals. Rather than being coordinated from one of the individuals in the groups themselves, this behaviour arises through self-coordination. The collective pattern merges from positive feedback mechanisms in local interactions, leading to the adjustment of the moving trajectory of the individual according to its flock mates. Flocking behaviour may optimize navigation, escaping predators by staying togethe and optimizes foraging efficiency by sharing information.

### Aim

Only based on the assumption of individuals steering towards the center of mass of the flock, this semester project tries to emphasize the importance of flocking for the escape from predators or when finding a food source.

### Outlook

Add the property that individuals try to avoid collisions with flock mates and that they steer towards an evulated direction. Moreover, having multiple centers of mass that are computet from nearest neighbour radius would help for a more realistic simulation.
